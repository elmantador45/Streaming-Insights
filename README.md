# Streaming-Insights
This project provides streaming insights for a selection of movies and TV shows using the Watchmode API. The insights include user ratings, genres with relevance percentiles, and the regions where the content is available. The project utilizes the Watchmode API to gather information about movies and TV shows. The API key used for fetching data is included in the code (Watch_script.js). If you run the code and it returns to you a bunch of "NA's" and "Unknowns," it means that my API key ran out of requests so that means you will have to create your account and use your API key. I doubt you may need to do so as I already have screenshots of my tables in the Medium post.
